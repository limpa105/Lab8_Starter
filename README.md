# Lab 8 - Starter
I worked Alone
1) I would fit my automated tests within Github actions that way all of the tests are run each time my code is pushed, and if I am working with a group; we all run the same tests in the same environment. Ideally we would also get an email that lets me know if all of the tests passed (1)
2) no 
3) No because the “message” feature of a messaging application interacts with many other features of the application such as receiving messages and thus cannot be independently unit tested
4) Yes because max message length is a feature that does not interact/rely on oher features and thus can be indepedently unit tested.  
5) ( please see screenshots of all tests in folder called screenshots (thank you!!))
