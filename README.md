# Lab 8 - Starter
I worked Alone
1) I would fit my automates tests within Github actions that way all of the tests ae run each time my code is pushed. Ideally I would also get an email that lets me know if all of the tests passed (1)
2) no 
3) No because the “message” feature of a messaging application winteracts  with many other features of the application such as receiving messages and thus cannot be independently unit tested
4) Yes because max message length is  afeature that does not interact/rely on oher features and thus can be indepedently unit tested 
5) ( please see screenshots of all tests in folder called screenshots (thank you!!))
